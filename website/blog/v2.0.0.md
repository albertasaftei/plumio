Version 2.0.0 of plumio is here!

<!--truncate-->

### Backup and Import

- Changed the backup folder structure to be more similar to third-party markdown editors, i.e **Obsidian** backups have the same structure, thus you can easily import from it as well. I don't have knowledge about other apps exporting backups with this structure but you can try them if the structure matches. _**Obsidian custom features are not yet supported**_ (internal links, tags, etc) but they will probably be added in the future.
- Added support for importing from zip files
- Filter out hidden files and folders when importing a backup
- UI visual feedback with a toast message when the import/export process is successful or failed

### Minor Changes

- Various UI improvements, code cleaning and bug fixes

Thank you for using plumio! 🎉
