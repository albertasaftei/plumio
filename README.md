## Introduction

plumio is a self-hosted markdown editor designed for individuals and teams who want a secure, private, and customizable note-taking solution. With features like live preview, document encryption, multi-user support, and multi-organization capabilities, plumio provides a powerful platform for managing your notes and documents.

## Key Features

- **Markdown Editing**: Write and format your notes using markdown syntax with a live preview.
- **Document Encryption**: Keep your notes secure with end-to-end encryption.
- **Colorful Items**: Organize your documents with customizable colors for easy identification.
- **Multi-User Support**: Collaborate with team members by creating multiple user accounts.
- **Multi-Organization Support**: Manage different groups or teams within the same instance.
- **Self-Hosted**: Take full control of your data by hosting plumio on your own server or local machine.

## Backup System

plumio includes an optional automated backup system that runs daily to protect your documents. You can enable or disable this feature as needed, and it will create compressed backups of your data while managing retention automatically. Otherwise you can create manual backups at any time and view backup logs to keep track of your backup history. For more details, see the [Backup System documentation](https://plumio.app/docs/configuration#manual-backup).
